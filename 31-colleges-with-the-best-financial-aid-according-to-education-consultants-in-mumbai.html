                                <p>In this section, Education consultants in Mumbai give you a list of schools that
                                    <b>claim to meet all their students' financial needs without having them take out
                                        any loans</b>. What that means is that your family will only be asked to pay
                                    what they can afford, and the school will cover the rest of the costs with their
                                    institutional financial aid funding.
                                </p>
                                <p>Many of these schools are <b>need-blind</b>, which means your financial status will
                                    have no bearing on your admission result.</p>
                                <p>You don't necessarily need to be low-income to have all your financial needs met. For
                                    example, Harvard doesn't ask for any contribution if family income is less than
                                    $65,000, and families will only need to contribute up to 10% of their income if they
                                    make between $65,000 and $150,000. Aid amounts operate on a sliding scale for
                                    families that make more than $150,000.</p>
                                <p><b>Students with the most financial need tend to get the most aid</b> because many of
                                    these schools' financial aid initiatives are based on removing barriers to college
                                    access based on finances.</p>

                                <p>You might have noticed that the schools in the table above are all pretty competitive
                                    private institutions. These private schools tend to be pretty elite, with strong
                                    alumni networks. </p>
                                <p><b>Successful alumni tend to donate more to their alma maters, leading to more
                                        financial aid funding and better financial aid programs.</b></p>
                                <p>They might have higher sticker prices than many public schools, but they tend to be
                                    less expensive for many students due to their financial aid programs.</p>
                                <p><b>Many of the above schools only offer need-based aid.</b> They don't offer
                                    merit-based scholarships because, as I mentioned earlier, their financial aid
                                    initiatives focus mainly on removing barriers to education access. They don't have
                                    to offer merit-based scholarships to entice applicants because their applicant pool
                                    is already so strong. </p>

                                <p>Some students might want to seek out financial aid even if they aren't eligible for
                                    many need-based programs. If you're one of these students, there's one important
                                    thing you need to know: <b>if financial aid isn't need-based, then it's

                                <p>Start your scholarship search with our guide to awards for high school seniors. Read

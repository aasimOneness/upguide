                            <img class="w-100" src="img/study-in-south-africa.jpg" alt="">
                            <div class="blog-text pt-4">



                                <p>Though the country is perhaps best known for producing AB de Villiers, Charlize
                                    Theron and Elon Musk, South Africa has the potential of being a great left-field
                                    choice for studying in as an international student. Here's 5 reasons why you should
                                    shortlist it, and 3 reasons why it might not fit your requirements.</p>



                                <p>Why shortlist it:</p>



                                <p>1. The best universities in Africa and the Middle East</p>



                                <p>Though a cursory glance at the rankings list shows top South African institutions
                                    lagging well behind their international counterparts in the US and Europe, they
                                    enjoy a great reputation within their countries (such as how IITs are perceived
                                    within India). This means that though they don't carry the obvious prestige of
                                    universities such as Harvard and Oxford, they promise to deliver the best education
                                    possible in the entire continent. As such, graduating at the top of one of these
                                    universities means that you might just become the most sought-after graduate in your
                                    field, in the entire continent.</p>



                                <p>2. Tourist Appeal</p>



                                <p>Yes, yes, we know. This is a college application portal and not a travel guide. That
                                    said, South Africa is one of the world's best tourist destinations and it keeps
                                    people coming back with a combination of amazing weather and gorgeous scenery. In
                                    fact, Cape Town was voted the world's best city by Telegraph, for the 7th year
                                    running. There are few better places to explore student life than in a country like
                                    this.</p>



                                <p>3. Affordability</p>



                                <p>South Africa offers prices which are significantly more affordable than Australia or
                                    the UK. Part of this is because South Africa's infrastructure isn't as good as
                                    either of the two countries - in fact the less said about South Africa's
                                    infrastructure, the better. However, students are likely to reap the benefits of
                                    these lower costs - tuition fees for a year at the University of Cape Town run up to
                                    $10k, and a little cheaper at the other universities. By comparison, a year of
                                    tuition fees in the UK or Australia can easily be $30k. Housing, food,
                                    transportation and entertainment is also significantly cheaper in this corner of the
                                    world, which means that a student budget can take you further here.</p>



                                <p>4. International Diversity and Appeal</p>



                                <p>Despite its incredibly troubled history, South Africa has evolved into one of the
                                    more cosmopolitan pockets of the world, where a culture of racial and cultural
                                    equality is encouraged. South Africa is also at the forefront of LGBTQ+ rights,
                                    which means that international students of any background will quickly feel at home
                                    in this country.</p>



                                <p>Among eleven official languages, English is also the lingua franca of this country
                                    ensuring that communication barriers are hardly ever a problem. It also means that
                                    South African universities are part of the English-speaking world of academia that
                                    seems to (for better or for worse) dominate the global academic scene.</p>



                                <p>In universities such as Witwatersrand and UCT, a large number of professors are
                                    trained abroad - including at Ivy League institutions - which means that you are
                                    guaranteed a globally-relevant education. Numerous institutions in the US (such as
                                    Yale) also have strong ties with South African institutions, which means
                                    study-abroad opportunities (both to and from South Africa) are plentiful.</p>



                                <p>5. Strength in particular fields</p>



                                <p>South Africa is particularly popular among international students in certain fields.
                                    For example, medical students have access to affordable English-administered
                                    education along with international recognition - a combination which is incredibly
                                    appealing and somewhat rare.</p>



                                <p>South Africa also has strengths in mining - gold, platinum, diamond and coal are all
                                    mined and processed in South Africa, and many universities offer courses on these
                                    (which rank among the best in the world). Associated degrees such as industrial
                                    engineering and electrical engineering are also highly sought after in this country.
                                    In addition, South Africa generally has a dearth of trained professionals in
                                    technical fields, which makes it a decent country to gain technical experience in
                                    before moving to another country.</p>



                                <p>And here's why you shouldn't move to South Africa.</p>



                                <p>Terminal Problems</p>



                                <p>I risk politicizing the issue, but South Africa is plagued with a myriad of issues -
                                    unemployment, electricity supply, painful bureaucracy, corruption, poverty, violence
                                    against women, racial tensions and very high crime levels in certain areas. To make
                                    things worse, it feels as if many of these issues are unsolvable - nobody with the
                                    power to do anything has done anything worthwhile.</p>



                                <p>Make no mistake, every country has problems. However, South Africa has problems
                                    deeper than most, and that is worth considering for any prospective students. It
                                    doesn't make it an unlivable country by any means - I'm living here - but it does
                                    require some serious soul-searching on what a student wants out of their youth. This
                                    is a country with some very high highs and some of the lowest lows. You'll realize
                                    you've never seen a better sight than sunrise over the Table Mountain, and you'll
                                    never feel as annoyed as when the power cuts out just as you start an assignment due
                                    at midnight. For some the sacrifice is worth it, and for some it won't.</p>



                                <p>The decline of industry</p>



                                <p>South Africa is not at the world's cutting edge of technology except for in certain
                                    areas, which means that employment is generally more lucrative in countries such as
                                    Canada or the United States. For instance, well-established multinationals like AWS
                                    (with a huge global presence) are only starting a South African wing in 2021. Many
                                    other brands and companies don't have a presence here at all. On the flipside, many
                                    brands that do set up in Africa base their operations in South Africa, making this
                                    country the de facto hub of industry in this part of the world.</p>



                                <p>One possibility for students is to use South Africa as a sort of stepping stone to
                                    other countries - an international experience at a low cost, with decent prospects
                                    of moving to other countries after the completion of the degree.</p>



                                <p>Degrees keep people out, not in</p>



                                <p>This is not a downside exclusive to South African universities, given that it applies
                                    to a majority of European universities and certain American ones (such as Purdue).
                                    Dropout rates are high at South African universities, as the transition from a
                                    relatively weak secondary education system to university proves too difficult for
                                    many. As such, well over half of all students drop out of a degree before
                                    graduation. For many international students this will be a threatening prospect and
                                    require every ounce of motivation that a student has in them. Students coming from
                                    international syllabi (such as A-Level or IB) will find this transition easier.</p>

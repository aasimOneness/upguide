                                <p>By Rivoo Bagchi</p>



                                <p>Chances are that most students will answer yes to this one - after all, who doesn't
                                    dream of securing a place at the most famous of universities? This Boston-based Ivy
                                    League institution is one of the oldest in the United States of America and carries
                                    immense brand cachet. In fact, Harvard is virtually synonymous with the top-tier of
                                    tertiary education. Leaving that sizable reputation aside though, does it have what
                                    it takes to be the correct fit for you? This is what alumni who have studied at
                                    Harvard seem to suggest.</p>



                                <p>Ivy League Cachet</p>



                                <p>Let's address the elephant in the room once again. Yes, it is true that getting
                                    accepted into Harvard does confer a certain social status upon a student. Your
                                    opinion seems to carry a little more weight, and peers that used to bully you will
                                    now ask you for college application advice. However, Harvard is distinctly perceived
                                    as 'elitist' in certain circles, and carries a connotation of privilege, unlike the
                                    fully meritocratic admissions system at its cross-town rival, MIT. As such, students
                                    would do well to let the new-found fame get to their heads. Enjoy it - because it's
                                    a momentous achievement - but be aware of how you are perceived by those around you.
                                </p>



                                <p>Some students would rather not have the weight of the 'Harvard' name on their
                                    shoulders, and they might prefer attending a more low-key institution in terms of
                                    global prestige. For example, institutions such as Caltech are just as well
                                    recognized in academic circles but will likely avoid the name-pressure of Harvard.
                                </p>



                                <p>Amazing academics</p>



                                <p>In terms of the quality of undergraduate teaching, Princeton University is generally
                                    considered to be the benchmark among the Ivy League colleges. However, Harvard
                                    doesn't lag far behind and most students feel that it is nearly as good. The
                                    difference lies in the fact that Harvard is just a touch more research-oriented,
                                    which means that there is more focus on graduate students and less on undergraduate
                                    students.</p>



                                <p>For most entering students, these differences will be trivial. Classes will be
                                    engaging and incredibly rigorous. In fact, though Harvard is perceived as less
                                    'nerdier' than MIT, it isn't much easier. Expect hours of work to get a GPA of 4.0.
                                    On that note, it is generally noted that Harvard isn't too afraid of grade inflation
                                    or awarding students higher marks. And despite the already-mentioned elitist
                                    reputation, most students and lecturers are very approachable - even the Nobel Prize
                                    winners. There's a lot of them on this 209-acre campus.</p>



                                <p>Not all Harvard degrees are equal though - this illustrious name carries more value
                                    in certain disciplines. For example, a Liberal Arts degree from here (Harvard was
                                    originally a Liberal Arts university) is virtually worth its weight in gold. It will
                                    open doors everywhere, from politics to the financial industry. On the other hand,
                                    an engineering degree - though well respected - may not be worth as much as one from
                                    Caltech, Stanford, MIT or UC Berkeley. Harvard doesn't have the biggest engineering
                                    department and is not generally perceived to be an school with an 'engineering
                                    focus' so as to speak. In fact, due to the general standardization of engineering
                                    (and similar) degrees worldwide, what you learn at Harvard may be quite similar to
                                    what is learnt at other institutions. This goes for many other technical subjects.
                                </p>



                                <p>In summary, the academic experience depends on what a student decides to study.
                                    Harvard certainly offers a quality education in every single subject, but that
                                    competitive edge is better realized in some subjects over others.</p>



                                <p>Social Scene</p>



                                <p>As with any other university, a lot of the social scene depends on what you make of
                                    it. Boston is one of the liveliest American students with a burgeoning student
                                    population, and Harvard students truly have the opportunity to meet a truly diverse
                                    set of individuals. In fact, there is even the chance to take classes at MIT - which
                                    opens up the door to make a whole new group of connections. </p>



                                <p>Be warned though - the student population is very smart. Most of them were likely
                                    class-toppers at their respective high schools and some of them are prodigies in
                                    their field of choice. It is advised that students are prepared to be humbled -
                                    there's always someone better than you at Harvard. </p>



                                <p>There is a quiet undercurrent of competitiveness - as it happens in any other
                                    top-ranking college. Every student wants to make the most out of their opportunity,
                                    and as such, Harvard can certainly not be considered a party school. Do expect some
                                    riveting conversations though. Harvard is known for fostering spaces for debates and
                                    intellectual discussions</p>



                                <p>Extracurriculars</p>



                                <p>Harvard has a burgeoning student research system for budding academics, and this is
                                    certainly one of the best ways to bolster your resume for the future. Every
                                    department offers this facility, and students can be expected to be helping PhDs and
                                    professors conduct their studies. On some occasions, students may be allowed to
                                    conduct their own research. Don't count on this happening though.</p>



                                <p>All manner of clubs are available, from developer societies to Formula Student teams
                                    to investing groups. Harvard is a highly motivated place, and students are expected
                                    to explore a few of these clubs while juggling their coursework. And even if the
                                    listed names don't appeal to you, Harvard almost certainly has another club that
                                    might appeal to you. And if they don't, there is almost certainly someone else in
                                    their student base that might be interested in forming a club with you</p>



                                <p>As you might have guessed, a historic institution like Harvard has a truly eclectic
                                    list of traditions, ranging from mildly interesting to 'I can't believe they
                                    actually adopt Polar bears'. It's safe to say that such an incredible collection is
                                    out of the scope of this article, but if you're staying on campus (as all first
                                    years are expected to do), you can expect this and a whole lot more. </p>



                                <p>Your Harvard experience will likely be a lot of things, but uneventful it will
                                    certainly not. There is always something to do and some way of improving yourself.
                                    At other institutions this may seem tiring - and it often is - but this is simply
                                    the expectation at Harvard.</p>



                                <p>Conclusion</p>



                                <p>To answer the question posited in the title of this article: Yes, you should consider
                                    Harvard unless you have an inclination towards another institution of a similar
                                    calibre. It offers an unmatched reputation, with an experience that genuinely lives
                                    up to it. It is no wonder that so many alumni still hold the same passion for
                                    Harvard as when they first strolled its ivy-lined alleyways. Simply put, there are a
                                    few chances that one regrets not taking - and this may be one of them.</p>



                                <p>It has its flaws: it's considered elitist, it's nigh-on impossible to get into, and
                                    to survive in an occasionally cut-throat environment needs (or perhaps encourages)
                                    incredible mental fortitude. But then again, most people considering applying to
                                    Harvard have likely enjoyed a challenge - and this is one of the biggest challenges
                                    as far as universities go. </p>

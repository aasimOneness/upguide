                                <p>It might seem tough, with Overseas Education Consultants in Mumbai, your ambition
                                    becomes achievable. You can create a list of Do's and Don'ts to achieve your
                                    ambition with the help of these below-given points, at the comfort of your homes.
                                </p>



                                <p><b>#1: Maintain a High GPA While Also Challenging Yourself</b></p>

                                <p>Most students probably know this, but you'll need a pretty high GPA to keep from
                                    getting rejected. Why? Well, a high GPA proves that you're not only responsible and
                                    studious but also capable of performing consistently well in a variety of
                                    disciplines. By excelling in several classes, you're providing direct evidence of
                                    your deep commitment to learning and academic success.</p>

                                <p>So, what constitutes a high GPA? The answer to this will depend on the school you're
                                    applying to. If you're applying to a top-25 school such as Stanford, aim for a 4.0
                                    or pretty close to it.</p>

                                <p>If you're not sure how high of a GPA your school expects, try looking on the school's
                                    website for any information or data about the average GPA of admitted applicants.
                                </p>

                                <p>That being said, getting a high GPA alone isn't as important as getting a good GPA
                                    and taking a challenging course load.</p>

                                <p>Here's what I mean by this: when applying to top colleges, a 4.0 unweighted GPA is no
                                    doubt great. However, you'll be a much more competitive applicant if you have, say,
                                    a slightly lower 3.8 GPA and have also taken loads of challenging AP/honors courses.
                                </p>

                                <p>This means that you could get mostly As and a couple of Bs in challenging AP courses
                                    and still have a higher chance of getting accepted over someone who got all As but
                                    took only easy classes. This is because colleges like to see that you're
                                    continuously challenging yourself. </p>



                                <p><b>#2: Get a High SAT/ACT Score</b></p>

                                <p>Like the tip above, this is kind of a no-brainer, but you'd be surprised how little I
                                    thought of it when I applied to college back in 2008.</p>

                                <p>While colleges understand that the SAT/ACT is just one part of your application, it's
                                    still pretty important to get a high score on one of the two tests—especially a
                                    score that sets you apart from other applicants.</p>

                                <p>A good SAT/ACT score will vary depending on the schools you're applying to. For
                                    example, if you were applying to Harvard, you'd want to aim for 1590 on the SAT or
                                    35 on the ACT. These are the 75th percentile scores for admitted applicants to
                                    Harvard. In other words, get this score level and you'll have a higher score than
                                    75% of applicants.</p>

                                <p>Even if you got slightly lower than this—such as a 1570 on the SAT or a 34 on the
                                    ACT—you'd still be in relatively good shape. The point, however, is that you want to
                                    shoot as high as possible so you can give yourself the best chance of admission.</p>

                                <p>On the other hand, if you were applying to a less selective school like the
                                    University of Houston, you'd only need an SAT score around 1300 or an ACT score
                                    around 27. Again, you could still get accepted with slightly lower scores than these
                                    but aiming high ensures you'll have a great shot.</p>

                                <p>As you can see, what's considered a high SAT/ACT score will depend greatly on where
                                    you're applying. If you can hit (or almost hit) your top-choice school's 75th
                                    percentile score, you'll stand out and lower your chances of rejection.</p>



                                <p><b>#3: Work On Developing Your Spike</b></p>

                                <p>This piece of advice is essential for those applying to the Ivy League or Ivy
                                    League-level institutions and here's what it is: part of crafting an incredible
                                    college application is working on developing a spike.</p>

                                <p>I briefly introduced this concept earlier, but now let's look at in detail. Your
                                    spike is what makes you stand out from other applicants. This is typically an
                                    ongoing passion for and commitment to academic or personal interest.</p>

                                <p>For instance, perhaps you're a lover of writing who's published his own self-help
                                    ebook and tutors elementary school students in creative writing on weekends. Or
                                    maybe you're a science whiz who's conducted numerous experiments and submitted her
                                    results to conventions.</p>

                                <p>Get the picture here? Think of this spike as the opposite of being well-rounded.</p>

                                <p>Now, here's what you can do right to help you further develop your spike:</p>



                                <ul class="py-3">

                                    <li><b>  ● Take classes related to your passion:</b>
                                        Into writing? Take extra
                                        writing-oriented classes such as newspaper, yearbook, or journalism. Also, if
                                        possible, opt for the hardest versions of these classes (e.g., take AP English
                                        instead of regular English).</li>

                                    <li><b>  ● Join a relevant club:</b>
                                        If you're a lover of geometry or calculus, join
                                        the math club. Putting in extra time shows that you're interested in this field
                                        outside of school as well.</li>

                                        This tip is especially
                                        relevant to those in the science field. Say you've got an invention, made a
                                        discovery, or created a piece of art that you want to show off. Don't just keep
                                        it for yourself—submit your project somewhere in order to highlight your
                                        commitment to making a change in the world.</li>

                                    <li><b>  ● Teach younger students:</b>
                                        Becoming a volunteer tutor/teacher
                                        demonstrates your devotion to helping others develop their passions in a field
                                        you enjoy. If you're an artist, volunteer to teach drawing or painting classes
                                        to students at a local Boys &amp; Girls Club, for instance.</li>

                                    <li><b>  ● Get a relevant part-time job:</b>
                                        Not all students have the time or
                                        opportunity to secure a part-time job in a field relevant to their interests,
                                        but if you can, I highly recommend doing so, as it can stress both your
                                        commitment to your field and your responsibility as an employee.
                                        All in all, don't rely on the trap of being well-rounded, particularly if you're
                                        trying to get accepted to highly selective schools.</li>

                                <p><b>#4: Write a Compelling Personal Statement and Consider Context</b></p>



                                <p>Even if you've got both stellar grades and a high SAT/ACT score, schools want to see
                                    that you're an interesting, passionate person who is committed to learning. This is
                                    why it's important to spend a lot of time crafting an impactful personal statement
                                    for your application.</p>



                                <p>In general, a good personal statement will accomplish the following:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li> ● Introduce who you are as a person (not just as a student!) and why you're applying</li>
                                    <li> ● Provide context for your academic accomplishments, passions, and future goals</li>
                                    <li> ● Focus on your spike and what makes you unique</li>
                                    <li> ● Answer the prompt clearly and fully (if given one)</li>
                                    <li> ● Use correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation</li>
                                    <li> ● Be the correct length and file format (e.g., PDF, .docx, etc.)</li>
                                    <li> ● Make the college want to admit you!</li>
                                </ul>



                                <p>The statement is a great opportunity to explain what your spike is, how you got
                                    interested in it, and what kind of role you see it playing in your future. For a
                                    detailed look at what makes for a powerful personal statement, check out our
                                    analysis of more than 100 college essays.</p>



                                <p>In addition, the personal statement lets you explain the context of your academic
                                    situation. For example, does your high school not offer any AP or honors courses? Or
                                    are you the first person in your family to attend college?</p>



                                <p>It's important to answer questions like these in your essay so that the school can
                                    take into account your personal circumstances as well as how these might have
                                    influenced the quality of your application. This way, you won't get rejected simply
                                    because you didn't take any AP courses (even though none might have been available
                                    to you!).</p>



                                <p>Many schools stress the importance of considering each applicant's circumstances. For
                                    example, here's what Stanford says on its website:</p>



                                <p>"We take into account your background, educational pathway, and work and family
                                    responsibilities. By focusing on your achievements in context, we evaluate how you
                                    have excelled in your school environment and how you have taken advantage of what is
                                    available to you in your school and community."</p>



                                <p>And here's how Duke considers your background in applications for admission:</p>



                                <p>"As a part of our holistic approach, we consider both your academic and personal
                                    interests, what you've accomplished, and your unique experiences, perspectives, and
                                    background."</p>



                                <p>Evidently, the personal statement isn't just an opportunity to showcase your spike
                                    and strengths—it's also a chance to explain your personal situation. Do all of this,
                                    and you'll be far less likely to get rejected for something like a slightly lower
                                    SAT score.</p>

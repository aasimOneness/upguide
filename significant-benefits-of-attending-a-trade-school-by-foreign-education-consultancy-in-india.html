                            <div class="blog-text pt-4">

                                <p>Foreign Education Consultancy in India urges that a trade school is better than a
                                    four-year full-time, college degree. The following points will help you determine
                                    the advantages and disadvantages of a trade school. At the end of the article, you
                                    will be able to decide better for yourself.</p>



                                <p>1.The most obvious benefit of going to a trade school is that trade schools require
                                    less time to complete. Almost all trade school programs can be finished in less than
                                    two years. Meanwhile, getting a degree from a community college normally takes two
                                    years, and getting a traditional four-year college degree usually takes at least
                                    four years to complete, sometimes few among the many students need a fifth or sixth
                                    year to get their degrees.</p>



                                <p>Less time in school allows you to get more job experience and progress faster in your
                                    career. Furthermore, if you're not in school, you won't have to pay for those
                                    additional years of college tuition and may have to take out fewer student loans.
                                </p>



                                <p>2. Another advantage of trade schools is the hands-on preparation you'll receive for
                                    a specific job. Many four-year colleges and programs at four-year colleges focus
                                    more on scholarly learning than on job preparation. For example, if you graduate
                                    with a degree in philosophy or theater, you may have difficulty finding a job that's
                                    directly related to your major. At a trade school, the focus is on learning the
                                    skills that you'll be using in your job when you graduate.</p>



                                <p>Similarly, because the goal at a vocational school is to acquire the skills for a
                                    certain job, it may be easier to initially find a job in that field. Also, many
                                    trade school programs are geared toward fields in which there is high demand for
                                    workers.</p>



                                <p>3. Additionally, there are lucrative jobs you can get with a trade school degree.
                                    According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median pay for dental hygienists
                                    was $76,220 in 2019. Meanwhile, the median starting salary for four-year college
                                    graduates was $51,347 for students from the class of 2019.</p>



                                <p>4.Finally, if you go to a trade school, you don't have to stress about the
                                    traditional college application process. Because the application requirements are
                                    much less strict at a trade school, if you decide to go to one, you won't have to
                                    spend the time or money associated with four-year college applications. You won't
                                    have to take the SAT/ACT. You won't have to stress about your grades. You won't have
                                    to worry about joining clubs just to enhance your college applications.</p>



                                <p>Disadvantages of Attending a Trade School</p>



                                <p>While vocational schools do offer some benefits, there are significant drawbacks,
                                    especially when compared to traditional 4-year colleges.</p>



                                <p>Even though there are financial benefits to going to a trade school, college
                                    graduates, on average, make more money than trade school grads. According to College
                                    Scorecard, the salary after attending, which is the median income for students
                                    receiving federal financial aid 10 years after graduating, for American Career
                                    College in Los Angeles ranges from $14,300 to $40,400 depending on the field of
                                    study. Comparatively, the salary after attending UCLA goes from $21,000 to $102,100.
                                    Even after accounting for the additional time spent in school, the average UCLA
                                    graduate is going to come out well ahead financially.</p>



                                <p>Also, four-year colleges tend to offer more generous financial aid. After financial
                                    aid, the average cost for West Coast University in Anaheim, California is $42,206.
                                    Meanwhile, the average cost for an in-state student at CSU Long Beach, a California
                                    State University, is $8,982.</p>



                                <p>Furthermore, if you go to a vocational school, you'll miss out on the traditional
                                    college experience. At trade schools, there's no real on-campus culture, and there's
                                    limited social interaction. At a four-year college, you can join clubs, attend
                                    campus parties, go to sporting events, join Greek life, and live in dorms with your
                                    peers. For many people, the college experience gives them wonderful memories and
                                    helps them form long-lasting friendships.</p>



                                <p>Much of the learning you do at a traditional college takes place outside of the
                                    classroom. You can attend lectures by famous politicians and prominent academics,
                                    and you're able to socially interact with students from all over the world.</p>



                                <p>At a trade school, the focus is on the job preparation you receive inside the
                                    classroom, and that's the extent of your education.</p>



                                <p>Additionally, traditional colleges offer a more broad, well-rounded education. Again,
                                    at a trade school, the education you receive is almost exclusively focused on
                                    preparing you for a specific job. At a traditional college, you'll have general
                                    education requirements that will expose you to a variety of different subjects, and
                                    even in many majors, you'll learn about a wide variety of topics.</p>



                                <p>In college, I was an American Studies major, which is an interdisciplinary major that
                                    focuses on the United States. I was able to take classes in sociology, education,
                                    religion, history, psychology, and political science that counted towards my degree.
                                    Outside of my major, I was able to take classes in numerous subjects like human
                                    biology, anthropology, statistics, and Spanish.</p>



                                <p>Traditional colleges pride themselves on not just preparing you for a specific job,
                                    but also teaching you critical thinking skills and making you an informed citizen
                                    who will be able to have a positive impact on the society outside of your
                                    profession.</p>



                                <p>Finally, there's more job flexibility with a traditional college degree. Trade
                                    schools prepare you for very specific jobs, but there are a wide variety of jobs you
                                    can get with a bachelor's degree, regardless of your major.</p>



                                <p>If you study medical assisting at a trade school, your program will only prepare you
                                    to be a medical assistant. If you end up deciding that you want to do something else
                                    or can't find a job as a medical assistant, your vocational school degree won't be
                                    of much value.</p>



                                <p>On the other hand, a degree from a four-year college offers you many more job
                                    opportunities. There are sales, education, and consulting jobs that are open to
                                    four-year college graduates from a wide variety of majors. Furthermore, you can
                                    pursue graduate school and professional schools like medical school and law school
                                    with a four-year college degree. On average, with more education and advanced
                                    degrees, you'll make more money and have more job security.</p>
